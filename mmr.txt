###  BASICS  ###

#Start everyone at 2000MMR
#After every game, compare average MMR of both teams. Standard MMR change is +/-25 with perfect balance.
#For every 50 MMR difference (in team average), MMR change should be increased by 1,2,3, up to 5 for each 50 MMR interval.
#e.g. Team 1 (2000MMR) vs Team 2 (2115MMR) results in a +/-28MMR change if Team 1 wins, and a +/-22MMR change if Team 2 wins.
#(25+(1+2) or 25-(1+2)). We'd also need a minimum MMR change to be set (something like +/-5) so that we don't have
#+/-0MMR changes happening at average MMR differences of greater than 350. We'd then also set a maximum MMR change threshold
#of 50, less the minimum MMR change.


###  CALIBRATION ###

#The first 5 games that any player takes part in will be their 'calibration games'
#In these games, they will receive a multiplier on their base MMR change which decreases throughout the calibration period.
#Initially, I'd suggest starting this multiplier at 2.0, then decreasing to 1.8, 1.6, 1.4, 1.2.

###  STREAKS  ###
#After calibration games, a win-streak/loss-streak system will come into play.
#After winning at least 2 out of 3 games, the next win will result in a 1.2x multiplier being applied to the base MMR change.
#Replace winning with losing for loss-streak rules.
#Essentially, you don't lose the streak until you go into the other type of streak (sounds a little weird).


### BASIC STEPS ###
#Find MMRs of players in the game
#Calculate team averages
#Compare team averages to find MMR balance number
#For each player, check if they are in calibration or not. If so, apply the relevant multiplier.
#If out of calibration, check which kind of streak the player is on and apply the relevant multiplier if the streak continues.
#adjust MMR using the now modified MMR changes.
